gap_number_YINS.f90 contains the Fortran90 code to self-consistently solve the gap and number equations at zero temperature for a density balance, equal masses electron-hole bilayer system with the inclusion of the Hartree-Fock term and without screening process. 
RPA.nb contains the Mathematica 14 code that evaluates all the first-order corrections to the normal and anomalous polarization function in the superfluid phase using the data produced by the gap_number_YINS.f90 code in the output "Deltakvkukd[value]YINS.txt"

Run the gap_number_YINS.f90 for a certain set of physical parameters to generate the "Deltakvkukd[value]YINS.txt" file, which contains on the first column the wave-vector k array and on the second column the corresponding Deltak superfluid gap value. 
Then, in the Mathematica code, insert the physical parameters of the system used in the Fortran code and the path of "Deltakvkukd[value]YINS.txt" file where required. Compile the Mathematica code, and the values of the polarization functions up to the first-order for a discretised interval of k are generated.
